Ztodo is an semi-supervised task classifer/exctractor trained using college
lectures. While still under development, I helped create a corpus from the
subtitles of 1000 hours of MIT OpenCourseWare lectures.

A text file containing sentences from this corpus, useful for random text
generation from the corpus is available [here](/data/mit_ocw.txt). The full
corpus will be released soon this summer, with additional lecture data from Open
Yale Courses.
